              <h4>Project Description</h4>
              <p>
                The web-map is developed within the PhD research project “Climate change resilient electrification of
                island communities in Southeast Asia”. The project aims to integrate climate change risk considerations
                into off-grid energy system planning. This is a first approach to facilitate the usage and application
                of gathered data for resilient energy system planning. The web-map provides an overview of climate
                change risks occurring on Southeast Asian islands and gives recommendations how to mitigate these risks
                by suggesting adaptation measures for system components. It also includes estimations of cost structures
                to implement these measures and demand increases based on climate change effects. The results (adjusted
                investment cost per system component and increased demand) may serve as input parameters to common
                energy system planning tools.

                as well as extraterrestrial radiation and soil water balance data. The index has no unit and an advanced

              <h5>Risk Cluster</h5>
              <p>
                Clustering is a method of analyzing large datasets by dividing them into various clusters, thus helping
                to recognize patterns in the dataset. The cluster analysis conducted in the previous research project
                acted as an aid to understand how climate risks were spatially distributed and if risk patterns could be
                recognized, to easily find out how big the influence of the climate risks for the islands were, or
                whether clusters were defined by an interaction of varying climate risks. Therefore, the clusters were
                not necessarily geographically connected, even though they had similar characteristics.<br><br>

                The islands grouped in the first cluster were located at the West and East edge of SEA mainly in the
                Philippines. These islands border directly the Indian and Pacific Ocean. Secondly, they are located
                predominantly outside 5° tropic corridor and were strongly affected by tropical cyclones. The tropical
                cyclones cause winter monsoon, with maximal precipitation between in winter.<br><br>

                The islands in the second cluster were mainly located in the inner tropics and south of it. Only few
                islands were located as north as in the Bay of Bengal. The average island size was smaller than in the
                other two clusters. The second cluster involved grouping predominantly small islands and few larger
                islands and were characterized by a low flood risk and low risk of tropical cyclones, yet the
                temperature increase was slightly higher than the first cluster.<br><br>

                High precipitation and high flood risk were dominant in the third cluster. A few islands were situated
                outside of influence of monsoon areas. Those islands were the largest in SEA, like Borneo, Sumatra,
                Java, and West Papua. These islands were topographically characterized by higher altitudes, mountains,
                and volcanos, resulting in higher precipitation than in surrounding areas. The big islands of the third
                cluster were mostly located in the inner tropics.

              <h5>Expert Interview</h5>
              <p>
                The list of potential adaptation measures as well as increased demand to reflect impacts of climate
                change were obtained by conducting expert interviews. In total 22 interviews were held with people of
                different backgrounds: project developers, technology providers, academia, insurance companies, island
                communities, energy cooperatives and energy policy. The goal of the interviews was to get a broad
                picture of both the implications of climate energy systems and the potential for adaptation.

              After deriving the data from the expert interviews, the data was evaluated, and a compilation was made
              comprising of advisable adaptation measures on system components tailored to a particular climate risk.
              The cost of the adaptation measure was also evaluated, and a percentage was determined. This percentage
              value refers to a percentage of the initial investment cost to implement the respective system components.

              The information being passed across is that it would take the initial investment cost for a particular
              system component
              plus the specified percentage (for a particular climate risk) of the initial investment cost to make the
              system component resilient.
